        "Chatbots can use a variety of techniques to generate responses to user input. A common one is based on rules where each rule consists of a pattern to be matched by the input, and an output that is generated in this case. [Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML)](http://www.aiml.foundation/doc.html) allows to specify those rules in XML format such that interpreters are available for executing those rules.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   Modify the chatbot to talk about your favourite topic.\n",
        "*   Ultimately, pattern matching is a bit inflexible against variations in word order, typing errors, etc. Another approach is to calculate the similarities between the user input and a long list of possible user input. The answer linked to the possible input that is most similar to the actual input is then returned. For this to work, one can convert a sentence into a feature dictionary using the bag of words technique, filter out stop words, and create feature vectors from the result using the tf-idf technique. Similarity between two feature vectors can be calculated using cosine similarity. You can add this approach to the chatbot, the individual methods are implemented within the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library and you find more information about them in the documentation.\n",

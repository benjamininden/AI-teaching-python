Python scripts / Jupyter notebooks for teaching AI

This is a (highly incomplete) collection of Python scripts that I created for teaching artificial intelligence classes. Of course, most Python AI packages these days come with excellent examples already, so I focussed on a few topics that I was not able to find elsewhere when I originally wrote the code. The notebooks are meant to complement theory-focussed lectures, so they do not explain the methods used in detail.
